# UE4SpotifyWebAPI
This Unreal Engine 4 Project makes use of the Spotify WebAPI to control spotify playback and get data such as Song name, artists, Album and Playback time

How to Use
=

* Create yourself an app over at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
* Set your Redirection URI to `127.0.0.1:8890`
* Fill into the `BP_SpotifyPlayerController` your `clientId` and `ClientSecret` in the defaults panel
* Press play and you're good to go! :-)


I'll update this piece over time :-)
